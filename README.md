I am a marketer, as well as a creative SMM content manager and a UI/UX developer. I can create different content for the project and use it to reach new audiences. Employees call me a "digital monster" because my work includes - Content plan, Analytics and hypothesis testing, Texts, Design, Visualization and creativity.
I have been working in the field of cryptocurrency for 2 years. At the moment I devote all my free time to this direction.
I do not stand still, I try not to burn out and constantly learn new things.
